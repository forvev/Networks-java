# SerwerSieci

In this program I deal with network communication using java. We  have two files which are client and server.

Server is running as first and after that client can run the program. The main idea is sending a message through the network, which will be encrypted using vigenere cipher. After all processes which consist of providing the data and encrypting them, everything is sent to the server. Server, which know the method, can decrypt the message and display it in the clear text on the screen. 

Each encryption and decryption step will be displayed on console.
